# Lidium
**Open Source 3D Point Cloud Processing Software**

## Summary

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors give huge amount of data, which generally need a variety of post-processing actions. These data are 3D point cloud containing the spatial coordinates and additionnal information like color or intensity of a numerous set of measures. Generally, the main use of these point clouds is the construction of a numerical 3D model of a real scene. The registration of point clouds took from different points of view, for example, is a painful task to achieve and requires usually some specific steps : cloud sampling and filtering, normal computation, just to name a few. But point clouds could also be particularly usefull with the support of the color or intensity information for object detection, material and structure recognition. A radiometric correction of the intensity is necessary to take advantage of this by-product information. Thus, we propose in this software an open source solution for visualization, easy manipulation and processing of point clouds, and some advanced algorithms for 1) radiometric correcttion of the the intensity information, 2) pairwise registration of multiple point cloud using different strategies.

Information on the used algorithms could be found in the article

abstract = {Alongside spatial information, an intensity scalar is also measured by LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensor systems. It corresponds to the amplitude of the backscattered laser beam after reflection on the scanned surface. This information isnâ€™t directly usable due to dependencies of geometrical parameters occurring during the scanning process and additional processing modifications. The research community, in a growing trend, invests efforts to convert this signal into a value which could bring qualitative and quantitative new applications. We propose in this paper, a review of the theortical background of LiDAR radiometric calibration, from physical background to state-of-art methodology. A comparison of two approaches to eliminate geometrical (range and incidence angle) and instrumental dependencies of intensity measurement is presented. Their application on several homogeneous areas of a real-world case study shows a significant reduction of intensity variation between surfaces with identical material composition. Finally, a linearization process permits to obtain an equivalent Lambertian reflectance value which, by its disciminant potential, could be specifically suitable for some algorithms like segmentation or registration.}
